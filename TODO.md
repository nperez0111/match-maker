- Message auth response as a message type?

- Sub document support: <https://github.com/toeverything/AFFiNE/blob/v0.9.0-canary.13/packages/y-provider/src/lazy-provider.ts>
- token management: <https://github.com/panva/jose>
- query awareness (fetch awareness from a client (so we don't have to wait 30s))
- better websocket connection management <https://github.com/jamsocket/y-sweet/blob/main/js-pkg/client/src/provider.ts#L580>
- see if need check sync status? <https://github.com/jamsocket/y-sweet/blob/main/js-pkg/client/src/provider.ts#L356>
- good example of how to split up a router for yjs docs: <https://github.com/jamsocket/y-sweet/blob/main/crates/y-sweet/src/server.rs#L338C46-L338C56>
- can do compact on dispose of a doc (since it is async, latency is not a problem)
- a message type for saving a snapshot of a doc
- open telemetry tracing for the server
